# Workshop: Analyzing and Visualizing Open Air Quality Data

This workshop is a brief introduction and practical tutorial on how to obtain,
analyze, visualize and interpret open air quality data with Python. We will be
using an analysis toolkit developed for this purpose. Participants are invited
to work through the examples, ask questions, explore the data and share their
interpretations.

## Program
1. Preparation, checking that participants' computers are ready to go
2. Introduction: what kind of data is available and what can we learn from it
3. Examples of open data sources
4. Worked example: retrieving, exploring and visualizing data
5. Notes on interpretation
6. Open exploration
7. Discussion
